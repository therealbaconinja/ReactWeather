1. run "node server.js"

2. localhost 3000

Notes:
- form onSubmit method always expects a function

Video 16 - Nested Components

State can be changed, Props can't!

Component types
0. Container - maintains the state, renders the children
1. Presentation - like GreeterMessage
Should never maintain state. Just render and call functions.
2. Input - gets user input from controls

Naming convention when passing Props as Functions to things like Forms..

<GreeterForm onNewName={this.handleNewName}/>

handle = function
on = handler
name = NewName

What is Webpack? (And Installing It)
Section 4, Lecture 19
https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-react-web-app-developer-course/learn/v4/t/lecture/4579162?start=0
Important for setting up new project for componentized development!
Note: Webpack treats EVERY file as an island, so you need to reference as follows:
var React = require('react');
var ReactDOM = require('react-dom');

Create webpack config file to simplify things to use babel, react, ES6
file: webpack.config.js

Building the file:
C:\Users\Baconinja\Documents\_baconinja\_react\HelloReact>webpack
Hash: f7176674dcf58304fc68
Version: webpack 1.12.13
Time: 64ms

./public/bundle.js  1.65 kB       0  [emitted]  main
   [0] ./public/app.js 62 bytes {0} [built]
    + 1 hidden modules
